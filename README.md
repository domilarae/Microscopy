These files consist of small programming projects that can be used to automate microscopy related tasks. 

# cell counter (WBC Differential)
This simple program allows the user to press the key on the keyboard to count white blood cells in increments and categorizes these cells as neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil, and basophil.

# WBC Correction Calculator (Project 2)
*Coming Soon* 
This simple program automates the white blood cell correction calculation that is performed in the presence of nRBCs during manual cell counts. 
* Use * 
The WBC correction calculation is used that compensates for the analyzer's inability to differentiate WBCs from nRBCs based on current methodologies of testing. The calculation is performed after comparing the user's manual count to the analyzer's automated count. This calculation may not be appropriate in all clinical sites or with certain instrumentation.
